# 🧠 Dizziness Detection Tool – Backend Development

## 📌 Overview
This project involves building the backend for a **Dizziness Detection Tool** that uses real-time video input and machine learning to predict dizziness or instability. It is designed to monitor user behavior and provide alerts when abnormal movement or signs of dizziness are detected.
